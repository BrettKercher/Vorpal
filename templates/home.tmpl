    ’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br/>
    All mimsy were the borogoves,<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mome raths outgrabe.<br/>
    <br/>
    “Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br/>
    Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frumious Bandersnatch!”<br/>
    <br/>
    He took his vorpal sword in hand;<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long time the manxome foe he sought—<br/>
    So rested he by the Tumtum tree<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stood awhile in thought.<br/>
    <br/>
    And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br/>
    Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And burbled as it came!<br/>
    <br/>
    One, two! One, two! And through and through<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br/>
    He left it dead, and with its head<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went galumphing back.<br/>
    <br/>
    “And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br/>
    O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He chortled in his joy.<br/>
    <br/>
    ’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br/>
    All mimsy were the borogoves,<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mome raths outgrabe.<br/>
